# FractalMaker
FractalMaker is a simple Swing application that demonstrates various
ways for how to modify a pixel buffer with arithmetic, biwise
operations, and bitshifts in order to generate a series of complex
and interesting patterns in the resulting image.

All methodologies presented in this demo were discovered by accident.
